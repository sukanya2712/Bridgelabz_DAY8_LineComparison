LINE COMPARISON COMPUTATION PROBLEM USING OOPS CONCEPT.

Start with Displaying Welcome to Line Comparison Computation Program on Master Branch

UC1 =>
As a fan of geometry, I want to model a line based on a point consisting of (x, y)
 co-ordinates using the Cartesian system,So that I can calculate its length.
 - A Length as 2 Points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) - Length of a Line = sqrt( (x2 - x1) ^ 2 + (y2 - y1) ^ 2)


UC2 =>
As a fan of geometry, I want to check equality of two lines based on the end points,
 So that I know when two lines are the equal.
 - Using Java equals method to check equality of 2 Lengths is preferable.


UC3 =>
As a fan of geometry, I want to compare two lines based on the end points,
So that I know one line is equal, greater or less than the other line.
- Using Java compareTo method to compare 2 Lengths is preferable.


UC4 =>
Use Java Object Oriented Programming Concepts of Line
and Point as well as equals and compareTo methods.
- Using Java compareTo method to compare 2 Lengths is preferable.
